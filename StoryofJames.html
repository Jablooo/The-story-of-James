It Was the Worst of Times;
It Was the Worst of Times;

I was born on a wave of bananas of a full moon.
Unlike her, the sea was flat and there wasn't a wave in sight.
The watermelons settled against each other like a finely stitched peice of embroidery.
Tempting me to lie on them like a giant hammock.
